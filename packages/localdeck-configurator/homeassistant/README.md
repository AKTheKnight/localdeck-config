## LocalDeck configurator for Home Assistant

To install, extract the contents of this folder to your Home Assistant `addons` folder.
In your Home Assistant dashboard, go to Supervisor -> Add-on Store,
and click the refresh button in the top right corner.  
The configurator should now appear in the list of available add-ons.

## Making your existing config compatible

There are a few minor changes you need to make to your existing config to make it compatible with the configurator.  
The online configurator has not been updated to reflect these.

Without these changes, your config will be read correctly,
but saving will override your config with the default config header.
